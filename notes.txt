00000-0FFFF: base 64k memory
10000-1FFFF: 64k memory expansion

18000 - 1FFFF: last 32k of base memory -- is this video page 3?

Video pages: 16k chunks numbered from 0 starting at 00000, 04000, 08000, 0C000, 10000, 14000, 18000, 1C000
 - Pages 1 and 2 are reserved
 - 32k modes use 2 pages, so valid pages are 2, 4, 6
 - Page 6 (0x18000 to 0x1FFFF) seems to be initial CRT page

0x3A080: This appears to be the whole frame but with different colors.  Bonus: Skeleton lines drawn in?

Rendering scheme
----------------
Scene resolution is actually 160x200, but each horizontal pixel is doubled to make 320x200
 - This is convenient because 320x200x16 encodes 2 pixels per byte.

Base page (0x8000): Contains color data interleaved with priority. Each byte contains color (high byte) and priority (low byte) for the next 2 pixels.
 - pri/skel (low byte) is 0 (for skeleton line) or 1-15 (for priority)
 - Also contains skeleton -- but how?

Compositor page (0x10000): Buffer area for new frame to be drawn. When drawing is complete this area is copied to the framebuffer.

Framebuffer page (0x18000): Video memory.

Each 'room' is 316x166 with a 2-pixel border on each side and a 1-pixel border on top and bottom.
 - The remaining 200-166-2 = 32 vertical pixels are for 4 rows of text at the bottom

Rendering loop - to be performed each time a sprite moves:
 - Erase all sprites in compositor:
   - Copy rectangles of data covering the previous location of each sprite from the base to the compositor.
 - Draw the sprites, in order of priority, in their new locations in the compositor. For each sprite pixel:
   - If sprite pixel is transparent or has a higher priority than corresponding base pixel, skip it.
   - Else, copy it over. 
 - Compute bounding rectangles of sprite previous and current location for each sprite; copy each from compositor to framebuffer.
