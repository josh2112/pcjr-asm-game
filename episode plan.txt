(DONE) Ep 12:
 - Double-buffering (non-interleaved compositor)
   - Fns for drawing solid rectangle and icon to compositor
   - Fn blt_compositor_to_framebuffer
- Each loop:
    - Erase (draw solid rectangle over) player current pos in compositor
    - Move player
    - Draw player icon in new pos on compositor
    - Blt rectangle (player new pos) from compositor to framebuffer

Ep 13:
 - Triple buffering (no reading files or piority checking yet, just
   draw some piddly background with setpixel)
 - Each loop:
    - Copy rectangle (player current pos) from background to compositor
    - Move player
    - Draw player icon in new pos on compositor
    - Blt rectangle (player new pos) compositor to framebuffer

Ep 14:
 - DOS INT 21h to read file into background
 - Priority checking when drawing icon

Ep 15:
 - Going back to INT 16H keyboard handling (instead of replacing INT 9H handler)
 - Text I/O area at bottom of screen

TODO:
 - Try episode-11 without "call waitForRetrace"
 - Test writing to different pages again 
 - Simple program to read file directly into framebuffer
