Ep 14:
 - DOS INT 21h to read file into background
 - Priority checking when drawing icon

Ep 15:
 - Going back to INT 16H keyboard handling (instead of replacing INT 9H handler)
 - Text I/O area at bottom of screen

future on PCjr observations:
 - Disk is corrupt? Disk drive needs replacement (problems reading known good disk this morning)
   - Try formatting a new disk
 - Even with corruption, input was still working OK, but cursor key movement wasn't. Error in the priority checker code?
   - Comment out bound_player and try again.
