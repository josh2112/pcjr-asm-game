Packet structure:
[SOH][PAKNUM][...FILEDATA...][CKSUM]
Packets are 131 bytes (128 bytes of data plus 1 byte each SOH, PAKNUM, CKSUM)

Reception algorithm:
 - Read 131 bytes into buffer
 - Verify checksum across entire packet (excluding checksum byte)
 - Verify first byte is SOH
 - Verify packet number
   - If any of the above three fail, send NAK and restart.
 - If first packet:
   - Extract file name (bytes 2-13) and file size (bytes 14-15)
   - set start of copy to offset 16 (instead of 2)
 - Copy FILEDATA into file buffer (smaller of 128 or (filesize-bytesrecvd))
 - Increment packet number and increase bytesrecvd by number of bytes copied
 - Acknowledge packet
 - If bytesrecvd < filesize, repeat. Else:
 - open file, write all of filebuf, exit.

[...FILEDATA...] is 8.3 filename followed by 2-byte file size followed by file contents
